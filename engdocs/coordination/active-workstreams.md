# Active Workstream Coordination

Last updated: 2026-05-18 12:58 PT by Mabel

This is a temporary cross-agent coordination channel, not product documentation.
Do not merge this file into public docs unless we explicitly promote it.

Use this file for concise handoffs between active agents. Prefer factual state,
links, branch names, and explicit interface constraints over narrative.

Severity labels:

- `red`: blocks another workstream.
- `yellow`: coordinate before touching the affected area.
- `green`: informational.

## Attention Protocol

Every workstream handoff should include an attention block so agents can poll
this file without D. Box becoming the notification bus.

Use this shape:

```markdown
### Attention Needed

Needs Mabel: yes/no

Needs D. Box: yes/no

Urgency: red/yellow/green

Reason: short factual reason, or "none".
```

If a workstream is blocked on another agent, mark the urgency and name the
needed owner in `Reason`.

## Current Attention Summary

- `yellow`: JSON needs Jasmine to assemble and validate `codex/json-rollup`
  before Cleo freezes registry command schemas/tests.
- `yellow`: Registry-gc-pack needs Mabel to flag any #2126 constraints that
  affect `gc import`, legacy `gc pack fetch/list`, or PackV2 import fields.
- `yellow`: gc4gc / Operational Substrate has not yet published a Grace handoff
  into this coordination file.
- `green`: Cleo's dirty registry work has been pushed to a preservation /
  workstream branch; no meaningful registry local-only state is expected.

## Communication Mechanism

Chosen mechanism: repo-backed coordination branch.

- Repository: `gastownhall/gascity`
- Branch: `codex/workstream-coordination`
- File: `engdocs/coordination/active-workstreams.md`

Agents should fetch this branch when they need the latest shared coordination
state. Agents may propose updates on their own branches or directly update this
coordination branch when asked, but this branch is not a product PR.

## Workstream Handoff

### Workstream

JSON

### Current Branch / PR

Branch: `codex/json-rollup`

PR: not opened yet

Base: `origin/main`

Owner: Jasmine

Worktree: `/Users/dbox/repos/gc/gascity-json-rollup`

### Latest State

Jasmine owns the JSON rollout end to end. The previous many-small-PR strategy
is replaced by a single JSON rollup / review-train PR so Julian can review one
coherent `gc --json` / `--json-schema` surface instead of many small PRs.

`codex/json-rollup` now exists and is pushed. It currently points at latest
`origin/main`; train assembly has not started yet.

Current JSON source of truth is this workstream section plus
`codex/json-rollup`, not any individual JSON PR.

Included provenance PRs for the first train, if they remain clean:

- #2317: schema-platform plumbing plus native management action JSON.
- #2222: session detail JSON plus oddball/root command JSON.
- #2250: formula/order inspection JSON.
- #2257: convoy inspection JSON.
- #2258: agent/rig routing inspection JSON.
- #2259: mail/trace/events inspection JSON.
- #2265: miscellaneous inspection command JSON.
- #2266: runtime/nudge/drain inspection JSON.
- #2267: doctor diagnostics JSON.
- #2271: lifecycle action summary JSON.
- #2273: graph/converge/order/formula action summary JSON.
- #2274: convoy/mail action summary JSON.
- #2287: open passthrough/custom schema support.

Conditional include:

- #2256: service/skill inspection JSON. Earlier failed CI looked like
  cancellation/flaky infra after local tests passed, but it must be revalidated
  before inclusion.

Excluded from the first train unless repaired:

- #2288: superseded by #2317's adoption branch payload.
- #2270: local rebase branch had `TestAutoSuspendChatSessions` failure from
  deprecated `[[agent]]` warning leakage to stderr.
- #2291: same local `TestAutoSuspendChatSessions` failure family as #2270.

### Interface Contracts Other Agents Must Honor

- Human-readable output remains default.
- `--json` emits deterministic machine-readable output.
- stdout must be JSON-only when `--json` is used.
- Human diagnostics and warnings go to stderr unless intentionally represented
  in JSON.
- `--json-schema` exposes command schema metadata. The role-specific form
  `--json-schema=result` is accepted for result schemas.
- Result schemas live under `schemas/<command-path>/result.schema.json`.
- Shared failure schema lives at `schemas/failure.schema.json`.
- Do not introduce `--format json`.

### Attention Needed

Needs Mabel: no

Needs D. Box: no

Urgency: yellow

Reason: Jasmine still needs to assemble and validate `codex/json-rollup`; Cleo
should not freeze registry command schemas/tests until that update lands.

Structured failure JSON policy:

- New JSON-enabled commands should use the shared failure schema where the
  platform path applies.
- Full structured failure JSON for every command is staged command-by-command,
  not a reason to block otherwise clean result-schema work.
- Commands with intentional command-authored nonzero JSON must preserve that
  behavior and declare compatible schemas/tests.

Schema extension conventions:

- JSON Schema remains the schema language.
- Gas City extensions use `x-gc-*`.
- `x-gc-jsonl` remains the convention for JSONL record-count metadata. Absence
  means a single JSON document unless command docs/schema say otherwise.
- Keep schemas open where the producer is a passthrough or custom command and
  Gas City does not own the payload shape.

Validation matrix for `codex/json-rollup`:

- `git diff --check`: pending for assembled train.
- `make fmt-check`: pending for assembled train.
- `make vet`: pending for assembled train.
- `make check-docs`: pending for assembled train.
- `GOOS=linux make lint`: pending for assembled train.
- `go test ./cmd/gc -run 'TestJSON|Test.*JSON|TestJSONSchema|TestJSONSchemaManifest|TestJSONCommandOutputMatchesDeclaredResultSchema' -count=1`: pending for assembled train.
- `go test ./cmd/gc -count=1`: pending for assembled train.
- `gc4gc` smoke tests: pending for assembled train.

Local-only JSON work state:

- The rollup branch is pushed at `origin/codex/json-rollup`.
- No meaningful rollup changes are local-only yet.
- Existing local worktrees for #2270 and #2291 contain unmerged/rebased state
  with known local test failures; they are excluded from the train until fixed
  or explicitly discarded.

### Blockers / Cross-Workstream Risks

- `yellow`: Registry/gc pack command schemas/tests should not freeze until
  Jasmine confirms the rollup branch has assembled schema-platform plumbing and
  the validation matrix is passing.
- `yellow`: Pack-defined commands may eventually need schema discovery rules;
  flag pack-facing schema changes to Jasmine rather than patching JSON rollout
  branches directly.
- `yellow`: Do not introduce `--format json` or command-specific schema
  discovery conventions in registry work.
- `yellow`: If registry commands need JSON schemas before the rollup lands, use
  `schemas/<command-path>/result.schema.json`, shared failure schema
  compatibility, and `x-gc-jsonl` for JSONL record-count metadata.

### Needed From Other Agents

- Jasmine: assemble and validate `codex/json-rollup`, then open the rollup PR.
- Cleo: flag any registry/gc pack command schema needs before freezing command
  output shapes.

### New Machine Bootstrap

Repos to clone:

- `gastownhall/gascity`
- `gastownhall/gc4gc` or the available local equivalent for smoke testing, if
  needed.

Branches to fetch / checkout:

- `origin/main`
- `origin/codex/workstream-coordination`
- `origin/codex/json-rollup`
- Provenance branches for included PRs:
  - `origin/adopt/ga-nqfs0pd-pr2288`
  - `origin/codex/json-schema-platform`
  - `origin/codex/json-wave2-formula-order`
  - `origin/codex/json-convoy-workflow`

  - `origin/codex/graph-converge-order-actions`
  - `origin/codex/json-convoy-mail-actions`
  - `origin/codex/open-schema-passthrough-custom`
  - optional after revalidation: `origin/codex/json-pack-service-skill`

Worktrees to create:

- `/Users/dbox/repos/gc/gascity-workstream-coordination` on
  `codex/workstream-coordination`.
- `/Users/dbox/repos/gc/gascity-json-rollup` on `codex/json-rollup`.

Local-only state:

- None for the rollup branch.
- #2270 and #2291 old-machine worktrees have local/rebased state with known
  failing tests and are intentionally excluded from the first train.

Commands to validate setup:

```sh
git -C /Users/dbox/repos/gc/gascity-workstream-coordination status --short --branch
git -C /Users/dbox/repos/gc/gascity-json-rollup status --short --branch
git -C /Users/dbox/repos/gc/gascity-json-rollup fetch origin --prune
git -C /Users/dbox/repos/gc/gascity-json-rollup log --oneline -1
```

Old-machine worktrees safe to ignore:

- Individual clean JSON shard worktrees after their commits are represented in
  the rollup branch.
- Deleted/gone provenance branches for already-merged JSON PRs.

Old-machine worktrees that must not be deleted yet:

- `/Users/dbox/repos/gc/gascity-json-rollup`
- `/Users/dbox/repos/gc/gascity-workstream-coordination`
- `/Users/dbox/repos/gc/gascity-json-session-mutation-actions` until #2270 is
  fixed or explicitly discarded.
- `/Users/dbox/repos/gc/gascity-json-gnarly-session-order-actions` until #2291
  is fixed or explicitly discarded.
- Any Cleo/Mabel/Penelope pack worktrees they own.

Exact first prompt for Jasmine on a new machine:

> Jasmine, continue the JSON rollup from
> `engdocs/coordination/active-workstreams.md` on
> `origin/codex/workstream-coordination`. Clone/fetch `gastownhall/gascity`,
> create worktrees for `codex/workstream-coordination` and
> `codex/json-rollup`, then assemble the JSON train from the included
> provenance PR branches in the documented order. Do not include #2270 or
> #2291 unless their local failures are fixed. Preserve the accepted `--json`
> / `--json-schema` contract and run the documented validation matrix before
> opening or updating the rollup PR.

## Workstream Handoff

### Workstream

Pack Deprecation

### Current Branch / PR

Branch: `codex/packv2-wave2-goodbye-packv1`

PR: #2126, <https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/pull/2126>

Base: `main`

Owner: Mabel / relevant implementation agents

### Latest State

#2126 is the source of truth for PackV1/PackV2 deprecation enforcement. It is
green and mergeable as of this update. It should remain conceptually separate
from registry/gc pack implementation.

Related docs/source reconciliation:

- #2318, <https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/pull/2318>

### Attention Needed

Needs Mabel: yes

Needs D. Box: no

Urgency: yellow

Reason: Mabel should confirm whether #2126 introduces any constraints that
affect `gc import`, legacy `gc pack fetch/list`, or PackV2 import fields before
Cleo freezes related registry compatibility behavior.

### Interface Contracts Other Agents Must Honor

- Do not remove or change `gc import migrate` semantics until doctor /
  `doctor --fix` parity exists for the migrate corpus.
- No new `gc pack` replacement command for `gc import migrate`.
- Remediation messaging must remain actionable for hard-failed legacy
  constructs.
- Coordinate before changing legacy `gc pack fetch` or `gc pack list`
  compatibility.

### Blockers / Cross-Workstream Risks

- `red`: Removing `gc import migrate` before doctor parity would break the
  migration contract.
- `yellow`: Registry/gc pack work may touch compatibility messaging around
  `gc import` and legacy `gc pack` commands; coordinate before changing those
  behaviors.
- `green`: Pack deprecation can proceed independently from registry/gc pack as
  long as compatibility invariants are preserved.

### Needed From Other Agents

- Cleo: keep deprecation/remediation changes out of the registry workstream
  unless a compatibility invariant directly affects canonical `gc pack`
  behavior.
- Jasmine: flag if JSON diagnostics or stderr behavior affects deprecation
  warning/error tests.

## Workstream Handoff

### Workstream

Registry-gc-pack

### Current Branch / PR

Branch: `codex/pack-registry-workstream`

PR: not opened yet

Base: `upstream/main` / `gastownhall/gascity@03c80562`

Owner: Cleo

Current implementation worktree:

- Worktree: `/Users/dbox/repos/gc-pr2119`
- Current branch: `codex/pack-registry-workstream`
- Pushed branch: `donbox/gascityworkplace:codex/pack-registry-workstream`
- Current checkpoint commit: `894654174cb44f50625c40e9c8426b121e58347d`
- State: clean and pushed as a WIP preservation/integration checkpoint.

Older local branches are not current:

- `codex/pack-registry-1a-core`
- `codex/pack-registry-mainline`
- `codex/pack-registry-latest-main`

### Latest State

Cleo will maintain one long-lived registry/gc pack workstream branch for
several days rather than preparing small immediate review PRs. Registry
operations still come first inside that workstream.

The registry/gc pack source of truth is now
`donbox/gascityworkplace:codex/pack-registry-workstream`.

Dirty/unpushed work has been migrated and pushed. No meaningful local-only
registry work should remain on the old machine.

First milestone inside the workstream:

- Stabilize registry operations only: `internal/gchome`,
  `internal/packregistry`, `gc pack registry list/add/remove/refresh/search/show`,
  result schemas, and conformance tests.
- Keep dependency mutation parked until registry config/catalog behavior is
  correct and validated.
- Tree hash, registry resolution, schema-2 lock metadata, and command-shape
  scaffolding may remain on the workstream branch but should not be treated as
  the first stable checkpoint until registry ops are green.

### Attention Needed

Needs Mabel: yes

Needs D. Box: no

Urgency: yellow

Reason: Mabel should answer Cleo's compatibility ask from the Pack Deprecation
train; Jasmine should answer JSON schema/failure conventions before Cleo freezes
registry command schemas/tests.

### Interface Contracts Other Agents Must Honor

- Registry operations land first.
- Dependency mutation must not race ahead of registry config/catalog
  correctness.
- Preserve current PackV2 import fields: `source`, `version`, `export`,
  `transitive`, `shadow`.
- Do not implement #2129 `[[exports]]` in this workstream; treat it as design
  input/future direction.
- Registry handles such as `main:lighthouse` are command-time selectors only.
- Durable `pack.toml` imports must store concrete `source` plus optional
  `version`, not `registry:<registry>:<pack>`.
- Lock/cache internals may preserve registry/ref/commit/hash metadata.
- Preserve `gc import` compatibility and legacy `gc pack fetch/list`
  compatibility.
- `gc import migrate` has no `gc pack` replacement; doctor / `doctor --fix`
  must reach parity before removal.
- Compose with Jasmine's JSON rollup conventions once stable.

File ownership boundaries for Cleo's workstream:

- Cleo owns new registry/gc pack implementation files and tests:
  `internal/gchome`, `internal/packregistry`, `internal/packsource`,
  packman registry/hash/lock additions, `cmd/gc/cmd_pack.go`,
  `cmd/gc/cmd_pack_registry*_test.go`, and `schemas/pack/**`.
- Other agents should not edit `gc pack registry` command behavior or
  `schemas/pack/**` without coordinating here first.
- Pack deprecation agents may edit deprecation docs/doctor surfaces, but should
  coordinate before touching `gc import`, legacy `gc pack fetch/list`, or
  shared PackV2 import semantics.

### Blockers / Cross-Workstream Risks

- `red`: Do not base registry command JSON/schema tests on an unstable or
  superseded JSON branch without Jasmine confirmation.
- `red`: Do not change `gc import migrate` removal semantics in registry work.
- `yellow`: Coordinate with Pack Deprecation before changing legacy `gc pack`
  `fetch/list` behavior.
- `yellow`: Coordinate with Jasmine before freezing registry command JSON
  schemas or failure behavior.
- `green`: Registry/gc pack overlap with Pack Deprecation is small and should
  be managed through compatibility checkpoints, not branch merging.

### Needed From Other Agents

- Jasmine: confirm JSON rollup branch and schema/failure conventions.
- Mabel: keep Pack Deprecation source-of-truth visible and flag compatibility
  drift.
- Mabel: confirm whether #2126 introduces any hard compatibility constraints
  that affect `gc pack fetch/list` or `gc import` wrapper behavior.
- Cleo: continue from the pushed workstream branch and update this section after
  each stable checkpoint.

### JSON Assumptions

- Use `--json`; do not add `--format json`.
- Registry result schemas live under
  `schemas/pack/registry/<command>/result.schema.json`.
- Every public and nested public schema field needs `description`.
- Real `--json` stdout must validate against `--json-schema=result`.
- Failure behavior must follow Jasmine's JSON rollup once stable; until then,
  treat structured failure JSON as a coordination point, not a unilateral
  registry decision.

Needed from Jasmine:

- Current JSON rollup branch.
- Final source of truth for `--json-schema=result` and shared failure schema.
- Whether `x-gc-jsonl` is accepted, and its exact shape if accepted.
- Whether new commands should require structured failure JSON immediately or
  only when they opt into schema-backed buffering.

### Pack Deprecation Assumptions

- #2126 remains a separate PackV1/PackV2 deprecation train.
- Registry/gc pack preserves current PackV2 `source`, `version`, `export`,
  `transitive`, and `shadow` behavior for now.
- #2129 `[[exports]]` is design input/future direction, not this workstream's
  implementation scope.
- `gc import migrate` remains until doctor / `doctor --fix` parity exists.

Needed from Mabel:

- Flag any deprecation-train change that would alter `gc import`,
  `gc pack fetch/list`, or PackV2 import field semantics.

### First Stable Checkpoint Validation Gates

Run from `/Users/dbox/repos/gc-pr2119` on `codex/pack-registry-workstream`:

```sh
go test ./internal/gchome ./internal/packregistry
go test ./cmd/gc -run 'TestPackRegistry|TestPackRegistryJSON|TestJSONSchema|TestJSONUnsupported|TestJSONExecutionFailure'
git diff --check
```

Additional required gates:

- `gc pack registry` text behavior covers list/add/remove/refresh/search/show.
- Registry JSON output validates against checked-in result schemas.
- Unsupported JSON command paths use platform behavior.
- Diagnostics do not pollute JSON stdout.
- Registry add/search/show cover stale caches, partial reachability, ambiguous
  bare names, removed snapshots, and invalid registry/catalog inputs.

## New Machine Bootstrap

### Repos To Clone

- Main implementation repo:
  `https://github.com/donbox/gascityworkplace.git`
- Upstream remote to add/fetch:
  `https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity.git`

### Branches To Fetch / Checkout

```sh
git clone https://github.com/donbox/gascityworkplace.git /Users/dbox/repos/gc-pr2119
cd /Users/dbox/repos/gc-pr2119
git remote add upstream https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity.git
git fetch upstream main
git fetch origin codex/pack-registry-workstream
git switch codex/pack-registry-workstream
```

Coordination branch:

```sh
git fetch https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity.git codex/workstream-coordination:refs/remotes/upstream/workstream-coordination
git worktree add -B codex/workstream-coordination /Users/dbox/repos/gc-workstream-coordination upstream/workstream-coordination
```

### Worktrees To Create

- `/Users/dbox/repos/gc-pr2119` for registry/gc pack implementation.
- `/Users/dbox/repos/gc-workstream-coordination` for coordination updates.

### Local-Only State

None required. Registry/gc pack implementation state is pushed to
`origin/codex/pack-registry-workstream` at
`894654174cb44f50625c40e9c8426b121e58347d`.

Old stashes on the old machine are preservation artifacts only:

- `registry workstream migration to codex/pack-registry-workstream`
- `pack registry work before true latest main`
- `pack registry work before main upmerge`

They should not be needed unless the pushed branch is lost.

### Setup Validation Commands

```sh
git status --short --branch --untracked-files=all
git log --oneline -5 --decorate
go test ./internal/packsource ./internal/packregistry ./internal/packman ./internal/config
go test ./cmd/gc -run 'TestPackRegistry|TestPackRegistryJSON|TestDoImport|TestImport|TestJSONSchema|TestJSONUnsupported|TestJSONExecutionFailure'
git diff --check
```

### Old-Machine Worktrees Safe To Ignore

- `/Users/dbox/repos/gc-pr2119` branches
  `codex/pack-registry-1a-core`,
  `codex/pack-registry-mainline`, and
  `codex/pack-registry-latest-main` are obsolete for active work.

### Old-Machine Worktrees Not Safe To Delete Yet

- `/Users/dbox/repos/gc-pr2119` should not be deleted until the new machine has
  fetched and validated `codex/pack-registry-workstream`.
- `/Users/dbox/repos/gc-workstream-coordination` should not be deleted until
  this coordination update is pushed and visible from the new machine.

### First Prompt For Cleo On The New Machine

```text
Cleo, continue the registry/gc pack workstream from:

- repo: /Users/dbox/repos/gc-pr2119
- branch: codex/pack-registry-workstream
- checkpoint commit: 894654174cb44f50625c40e9c8426b121e58347d
- coordination file: /Users/dbox/repos/gc-workstream-coordination/engdocs/coordination/active-workstreams.md

First, refresh upstream/main and the coordination branch, verify the setup with
the commands in the New Machine Bootstrap section, then continue by stabilizing
the first registry-ops checkpoint. Keep registry/gc pack separate from PackV2
deprecation except for explicit compatibility checkpoints.
```

## Workstream Handoff

### Workstream

Pack Reuse / Customization Design

### Current Branch / PR

Branch: managed by Penelope on another machine

PR: feeds into #2119 / #2129 as appropriate

Base: not tracked in this coordination file

Owner: Penelope

### Latest State

Penelope is continuing the user-facing pack reuse/customization guide and
design exploration on a separate machine. Do not migrate or interrupt that
context from this coordination branch.

### Attention Needed

Needs Mabel: no

Needs D. Box: no

Urgency: green

Reason: Penelope is intentionally staying on a separate machine; only update
this coordination file if her guide decisions affect #2119, #2129, registry/gc
pack CLI wording, or import/export semantics.

### Interface Contracts Other Agents Must Honor

- Treat #2129 `[[exports]]` as future design input, not as implemented registry
  behavior.
- Keep user-facing guide language aligned with actual implementation state.

### Blockers / Cross-Workstream Risks

- `yellow`: Reuse/customization guide may update terminology or examples used
  by #2119 and future registry docs.

### Needed From Other Agents

- Penelope: surface guide decisions that change registry/gc pack CLI wording or
  import/export semantics.

### Last Updated

## Workstream Handoff

### Workstream

gc4gc / Operational Substrate

### Current Branch / PR

Branch: pending Grace handoff

PR: none expected

Base: pending Grace handoff

Owner: Grace

### Latest State

Grace has been asked to publish a gc4gc handoff into this coordination file.
No Grace-authored coordination update is present yet.

Expected scope:

- Stable gc4gc consumer worktree and branch.
- Producer/dev worktree and branch.
- Producer/consumer split status.
- Stable run artifact contract.
- New-machine bootstrap and validation commands.
- Product issues discovered while using Gas City from Codex.

### Interface Contracts Other Agents Must Honor

- Codex remains the human-facing cockpit.
- Gas City/gc4gc is the backend execution substrate.
- Stable consumer worktree remains the only consumer-facing runtime unless
  explicitly promoted.
- Do not make gc4gc a second cockpit.
- Do not change JSON or registry implementation from this lane unless Jasmine
  or Cleo asks.

### Attention Needed

Needs Mabel: yes

Needs D. Box: no

Urgency: yellow

Reason: Grace has not yet published the gc4gc / Operational Substrate handoff
or new-machine bootstrap into this coordination file.

### Blockers / Cross-Workstream Risks

- `yellow`: gc4gc may need to validate against Jasmine's JSON rollup once that
  branch is assembled.
- `yellow`: gc4gc may surface product friction for Cleo's registry/gc pack work
  but should not directly alter implementation branches.

### Needed From Other Agents

- Grace: publish the gc4gc handoff and bootstrap details.
- Jasmine: notify Grace when `codex/json-rollup` is ready for gc4gc smoke
  testing.
- Cleo: notify Grace if registry/gc pack work needs dogfood validation through
  gc4gc.
